<h2>Using Keywords to Control Tinker Calculations<a class="headerlink" href="#using-keywords-to-control-tinker-calculations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section contains detailed descriptions of the keyword parameters used to define or alter the course of a Tinker calculation. The keyword control file is optional in the sense that all of the Tinker programs will run in the absence of a keyfile and will simply use default values or query the user for needed information. However, the keywords allow use of a wide variety of algorithmic and procedural options, many of which are unavailable interactively.</p>
<p>Keywords are read from the keyword control file. All programs look first for a keyfile with the same base name as the input molecular system and ending in the extension .key. If this file does not exist, then Tinker tries to use a generic keyfile with the name Tinker.key and located in the same directory as the input system. If neither a system-specific nor a generic keyfile is present, Tinker will continue by using default values for keyword options and asking interactive questions as necessary.</p>
<p>Tinker searches the keyfile during the course of a calculation for relevant keywords that may be present. All keywords must appear as the first word on the line. Any blank space to the left of the keyword is ignored, and all contents of the keyfiles are case insensitive. Some keywords take modifiers; i.e., Tinker looks further on the same line for additional information, such as the value of some parameter related to the keyword. Modifier information is read in free format, but must be completely contained on the same line as the original keyword. Any lines contained in the keyfile which do not qualify as valid keyword lines are treated as comments and are simply ignored.</p>
<p>Several keywords take a list of integer values (atom numbers, for example) as modifiers. For these keywords the integers can simply be listed explicitly and separated by spaces, commas or tabs. If a range of numbers is desired, it can be specified by listing the negative of the first number of the range, followed by a separator and the last number of the range. For example, the keyword line ACTIVE 4 -9 17 23 could be used to add atoms 4, 9 through 17, and 23 to the set of active atoms during a Tinker calculation.</p>

<h2>Description of Individual Keywords<a class="headerlink" href="#description-of-individual-keywords" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following is an alphabetical list of the Tinker keywords along with a brief description of the action of each keyword and required or optional parameters that can be used to extend or modify each keyword. The format of possible modifiers, if any, is shown in brackets following each keyword.</p>
<p><strong>A-AXIS [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the a-axis length for a crystal unit cell, or, equivalently, the X-axis length for a periodic box. The length value in Angstroms is listed after the keyword. Equivalent to the X-AXIS keyword.</p>
<p><strong>A-EXPTERM [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the “A” premultiplier term in the Buckingham van der Waals function, i.e., the value of A in the formula Evdw = epsilon * { A exp[-B(Ro/R)] - C (Ro/R)6 }.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIVE [integer list]</strong>  Sets the list of active atoms during a Tinker computation. Individual potential energy terms are computed when at least one atom involved in the term is active. For Cartesian space calculations, active atoms are those allowed to move. For torsional space calculations, rotations are allowed when all atoms on one side of the rotated bond are active. Multiple ACTIVE lines can be present in the keyfile and are treated cumulatively.  On each line the keyword can be followed by one or more atom numbers or atom ranges. The presence of any ACTIVE keyword overrides any INACTIVE keywords in the keyfile.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIVE-SPHERE [4 reals, or 1 integer &amp; 1 real]</strong>  Provides an alternative to the ACTIVE and INACTIVE keywords for specification of subsets of active atoms. If four real number modifiers are provided, the first three are taken as X-, Y- and Z-coordinates and the fourth is the radius of a sphere centered at these coordinates. In this case, all atoms within the sphere at the start of the calculation are active throughout the calculation, while all other atoms are inactive. Similarly if one integer and real number are given, an “active” sphere with radius set by the real is centered on the system atom with atom number given by the integer modifier. Multiple SPHERE keyword lines can be present in a single keyfile, and the list of active atoms specified by the spheres is cumulative.</p>
<p><strong>AGRID [3 reals]</strong>  Sets grid dimensions along the X-, Y- and Z-axes which are passed on to the Tinker APBS interface for use in Poisson-Boltzmann calculations.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the alpha angle of a crystal unit cell, i.e., the angle between the b-axis and c-axis of a unit cell, or, equivalently, the angle between the Y-axis and Z-axis of a periodic box. The default value in the absence of the ALPHA keyword is 90 degrees.</p>
<p><strong>ANGANG [1 integer &amp; 3 reals]</strong>  Provides the values for a single angle-angle cross term potential parameter. The integer modifier is the atom class of the central atom in the coupled angles. The real number modifiers give the force constant values for individual angles with 0, 1 or 2 terminal hydrogen atoms, respectively. The default units for the force constant are kcal/mole/radian^2, but this can be controlled via the ANGANGUNIT keyword.</p>
<p><strong>ANGANGTERM [NONE/ONLY]</strong>  Controls use of the angle-angle cross term potential energy. In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy terms except for this one.</p>
<p><strong>ANGANGUNIT [real]</strong>  Sets the scale factor needed to convert the energy value computed by the angle-angle cross term potential into units of kcal/mole. The correct value is force field dependent and typically provided in the header of the master force field parameter file. The default of (Pi/180)^2 = 0.0003046 is used, if the ANGANGUNIT keyword is not given in the force field parameter file or the keyfile.</p>
<p><strong>ANGCFLUX [3 integers &amp; 4 reals]</strong></p>
<p><strong>ANGLE [3 integers &amp; 4 reals]</strong>  Provides the values for a single bond angle bending parameter. The integer modifiers give the atom class numbers for the three kinds of atoms involved in the angle which is to be defined. The real number modifiers give the force constant value for the angle and up to three ideal bond angles in degrees. In most cases only one ideal bond angle is given, and that value is used for all occurrences of the specified bond angle. If all three ideal angles are given, the values apply when the central atom of the angle is attached to 0, 1 or 2 additional hydrogen atoms, respectively. This “hydrogen environment” option is provided to implement the corresponding feature of Allinger’s MM force fields. The default units for the force constant are kcal/mole/radian^2, but this can be controlled via the ANGLEUNIT keyword.</p>
<p><strong>ANGLE-CUBIC [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the cubic term in the Taylor series expansion form of the bond angle bending potential energy. The real number modifier gives the value of the coefficient as a multiple of the quadratic coefficient. This term multiplied by the angle bending energy unit conversion factor, the force constant, and the cube of the deviation of the bond angle from its ideal value gives the cubic contribution to the angle bending energy. The default value in the absence of the ANGLE-CUBIC keyword is zero; i.e., the cubic angle bending term is omitted.</p>
<p><strong>ANGLE-PENTIC [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the fifth power term in the Taylor series expansion form of the bond angle bending potential energy. The real number modifier gives the value of the coefficient as a multiple of the quadratic coefficient. This term multiplied by the angle bending energy unit conversion factor, the force constant, and the fifth power of the deviation of the bond angle from its ideal value gives the pentic contribution to the angle bending energy. The default value in the absence of the ANGLE-PENTIC keyword is zero; i.e., the pentic angle bending term is omitted.</p>
<p><strong>ANGLE-QUARTIC [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the quartic term in the Taylor series expansion form of the bond angle bending potential energy. The real number modifier gives the value of the coefficient as a multiple of the quadratic coefficient. This term multiplied by the angle bending energy unit conversion factor, the force constant, and the forth power of the deviation of the bond angle from its ideal value gives the quartic contribution to the angle bending energy. The default value in the absence of the ANGLE-QUARTIC keyword is zero; i.e., the quartic angle bending term is omitted.</p>
<p><strong>ANGLE-SEXTIC [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the sixth power term in the Taylor series expansion form of the bond angle bending potential energy. The real number modifier gives the value of the coefficient as a multiple of the quadratic coefficient. This term multiplied by the angle bending energy unit conversion factor, the force constant, and the sixth power of the deviation of the bond angle from its ideal value gives the sextic contribution to the angle bending energy. The default value in the absence of the ANGLE-SEXTIC keyword is zero; i.e., the sextic angle bending term is omitted.</p>
<p><strong>ANGLE3 [3 integers &amp; 4 reals]</strong>  Provides the values for a single bond angle bending parameter specific to atoms in 3-membered rings. The integer modifiers give the atom class numbers for the three kinds of atoms involved in the angle which is to be defined. The real number modifiers give the force constant value for the angle and up to three ideal bond angles in degrees. If all three ideal angles are given, the values apply when the central atom of the angle is attached to 0, 1 or 2 additional hydrogen atoms, respectively. The default units for the force constant are kcal/mole/radian^2, but this can be controlled via the ANGLEUNIT keyword. If any ANGLE3 keywords are present, either in the master force field parameter file or the keyfile, then Tinker requires that special ANGLE3 parameters be given for all angles in 3-membered rings. In the absence of any ANGLE3 keywords, standard ANGLE parameters will be used for bonds in 3-membered rings.</p>
<p><strong>ANGLE4 [3 integers &amp; 4 reals]</strong>  Provides the values for a single bond angle bending parameter specific to atoms in 4-membered rings. The integer modifiers give the atom class numbers for the three kinds of atoms involved in the angle which is to be defined. The real number modifiers give the force constant value for the angle and up to three ideal bond angles in degrees. If all three ideal angles are given, the values apply when the central atom of the angle is attached to 0, 1 or 2 additional hydrogen atoms, respectively. The default units for the force constant are kcal/mole/radian^2, but this can be controlled via the ANGLEUNIT keyword. If any ANGLE4 keywords are present, either in the master force field parameter file or the keyfile, then Tinker requires that special ANGLE4 parameters be given for all angles in 4-membered rings. In the absence of any ANGLE4 keywords, standard ANGLE parameters will be used for bonds in 4-membered rings.</p>
<p><strong>ANGLE5 [3 integers &amp; 4 reals]</strong>  Provides the values for a single bond angle bending parameter specific to atoms in 5-membered rings. The integer modifiers give the atom class numbers for the three kinds of atoms involved in the angle which is to be defined. The real number modifiers give the force constant value for the angle and up to three ideal bond angles in degrees. If all three ideal angles are given, the values apply when the central atom of the angle is attached to 0, 1 or 2 additional hydrogen atoms, respectively. The default units for the force constant are kcal/mole/radian^2, but this can be controlled via the ANGLEUNIT keyword. If any ANGLE5 keywords are present, either in the master force field parameter file or the keyfile, then Tinker requires that special ANGLE5 parameters be given for all angles in 5-membered rings. In the absence of any ANGLE5 keywords, standard ANGLE parameters will be used for bonds in 5-membered rings.</p>
<p><strong>ANGLEF [3 integers &amp; 3 reals]</strong>  Provides the values for a single bond angle bending parameter for a SHAPES-style Fourier potential function. The integer modifiers give the atom class numbers for the three kinds of atoms involved in the angle which is to be defined. The real number modifiers give the force constant value for the angle, the angle shift in degrees, and the periodicity value. Note that the force constant should be given as the “harmonic” value and not the native Fourier value. The default units for the force constant are kcal/mole/radian^2, but this can be controlled via the ANGLEUNIT keyword.</p>
<p><strong>ANGLEP</strong> [3 integers &amp; 3 reals]**  Provides the values for a single projected in-plane bond angle bending parameter. The integer modifiers give the atom class numbers for the three kinds of atoms involved in the angle which is to be defined. The real number modifiers give the force constant value for the angle and up to two ideal bond angles in degrees. In most cases only one ideal bond angle is given, and that value is used for all occurrences of the specified bond angle. If all two ideal angles are given, the values apply when the central atom of the angle is attached to 0 or 1 additional hydrogen atoms, respectively. This “hydrogen environment” option is provided to implement the corresponding feature of Allinger’s MM force fields. The default units for the force constant are kcal/mole/radian2, but this can be controlled via the ANGLEUNIT keyword.</p>
<p><strong>ANGLETERM [NONE/ONLY]</strong>  Controls use of the bond angle bending potential energy term. In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy terms except for this one.</p>
<p><strong>ANGLEUNIT [real]</strong>  Sets the scale factor needed to convert the energy value computed by the bond angle bending potential into units of kcal/mole.

In the absence of the EWALD-ALPHA keyword, a value is chosen which causes interactions outside the real-space cutoff to be below a fixed tolerance. For most standard applications of Ewald summation, the program default should be used.</p>
<p><strong>EWALD-BOUNDARY</strong>  Invokes the use of insulating (ie, vacuum) boundary conditions during Ewald summation, corresponding to the media surrounding the system having a dielectric value of 1. The default in the absence of the EWALD-BOUNDARY keyword is to use conducting (ie, tinfoil) boundary conditions where the surrounding media is assumed to have an infinite dielectric value.</p>
<p><strong>EWALD-CUTOFF [real]</strong>  Sets the value in Angstroms of the real-space distance cutoff for use during Ewald summation. By default, in the absence of the EWALD-CUTOFF keyword, a value of 7.0 is used.</p>
<p><strong>EXIT-PAUSE</strong>  Causes Tinker programs to pause and wait for a carriage return at the end of executation prior to returning control to the operating system. This is useful to keep the execution window open following termination on machines running Microsoft Windows or Apple MacOS. The default in the absence of the EXIT-PAUSE keyword, is to return control to the operating system immediately at program termination.</p>
<p><strong>EXTRATERM [NONE/ONLY]</strong>  Controls use of the user defined extra potential energy term. In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy terms except for this one.</p>
<p><strong>FCTMIN [real]</strong>  Sets a convergence criterion for successful completion of a Tinker optimization. If the value of the optimization objective function, typically the potential energy, falls below the value set by FCTMIN, then the optimization is deemed to have converged. The default value in the absence of the FCTMIN keyword is -1000000, effectively removing this criterion as a possible agent for termination.</p>

<p><strong>FRICTION [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the frictional coefficient in 1/ps for use with stochastic dynamics. The default value used in the absence of the FRICTION keyword is 91.0, which is generally appropriate for water.</p>
<p><strong>FRICTION-SCALING</strong>  Turns on the use of atomic surface area-based scaling of the frictional coefficient during stochastic dynamics. When in use, the coefficient for each atom is multiplied by that atom’s fraction of exposed surface area. The default in the absence of the keyword is to omit the scaling and use the full coefficient value for each atom.</p>
<p><strong>GAMMA [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the gamma angle of a crystal unit cell, i.e., the angle between the a-axis and b-axis of a unit cell, or, equivalently, the angle between the X-axis and Y-axis of a periodic box. The default value in the absence of the GAMMA keyword is to set the gamma angle equal to the gamma angle as given by the keyword ALPHA.</p>
<p><strong>GAMMA-HALGREN [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the gamma parameter in Halgren’s buffered 14-7 vdw potential energy functional form. In the absence of the GAMMA-HALGREN keyword, a default value of 0.12 is used.</p>
<p><strong>GAMMAMIN [real]</strong>  Sets the convergence target value for gamma during searches for maxima along the quadratic synchronous transit used by the SADDLE program. The value of gamma is the square of the ratio of the gradient projection along the path to the total gradient. A default value of 0.00001 is used in the absence of the GAMMAMIN keyword.</p>
<p><strong>GAUSSTYPE [LJ-2/LJ-4/MM2-2/MM3-2/IN-PLACE]</strong>  Specifies the underlying vdw form that a Gaussian vdw approximation will attempt to fit as the number of terms to be used in a Gaussian approximation of the Lennard-Jones van der Waals potential. The text modifier gives the name of the functional form to be used. Thus LJ-2 as a modifier will result in a 2-Gaussian fit to a Lennard-Jones vdw potential. The GAUSSTYPE keyword only takes effect when VDWTYPE is set to GAUSSIAN. This keyword has no default value.</p>
<p><strong>GCENT [3 reals]</strong>  Sets grid dimensions along the X-, Y- and Z-axes which are passed on to the Tinker APBS interface for use in Poisson-Boltzmann calculations.</p>

<p><strong>GROUP [integer, integer list]</strong>  Defines an atom group as a substructure within the full input molecular structure. The value of the first integer is the group number which must be in the range from 1 to the maximum number of allowed groups. The remaining intergers give the atom or atoms contained in this group as one or more atom numbers or ranges. Multiple keyword lines can be used to specify additional atoms in the same group. Note that an atom can only be in one group, the last group to which it is assigned is the one used.</p>
<p><strong>GROUP-INTER</strong>  Assigns a value of 1.0 to all inter-group interactions and a value of 0.0 to all intra-group interactions. For example, combination with the GROUP-MOLECULE keyword provides for rigid-body calculations.</p>
<p><strong>GROUP-INTRA</strong>  Assigns a value of 1.0 to all intra-group interactions and a value of 0.0 to all inter-group interactions.</p>
<p><strong>GROUP-MOLECULE</strong>  Sets each individual molecule in the system to be a separate atom group, but does not assign weights to group-group interactions.</p>
<p><strong>GROUP-SELECT [2 integers, real]</strong>  Assigns a weight in the final potential energy of a specified set of intra- or intergroup interactions. The integer modifiers give the group numbers of the groups involved. If the two numbers are the same, then an intragroup set of interactions is specified. The real modifier gives the weight by which all energetic interactions in this set will be multiplied before incorporation into the final potential energy. If omitted as a keyword modifier, the weight will be set to 1.0 by default. If any SELECT-GROUP keywords are present, then any set of interactions not specified in a SELECT-GROUP keyword is given a zero weight. The default when no SELECT-GROUP keywords are specified is to use all intergroup interactions with a weight of 1.0 and to set all intragroup interactions to zero.</p>
<p><strong>HBOND [2 integers &amp; 2 reals]</strong>  Provides the values for the MM3-style directional hydrogen bonding parameters for a single pair of atoms. The integer modifiers give the pair of atom class numbers for which hydrogen bonding parameters are to be defined. The two real number modifiers give the values of the minimum energy contact distance in Angstroms and the well depth at the minimum distance in kcal/mole.</p>
<p><strong>HEAVY-HYDROGEN [real]</strong>  Turns on use of hydrogen mass repartitioning (HMR) and sets the target value for hydrogen masses. HMR transfers atomic mass from heavy atoms to their attached hydrogen atoms. Mass transfer is allowed until the hydrogen mass target is reached, or until a heavy atom and its attached hydrogens all have equal mass. A default value of 4.0 is used as the hydrogen mass target in the absence of the HEAVY-HYDROGEN keyword.</p>
<p><strong>HESSIAN-CUTOFF [real]</strong>  Defines a lower limit for significant Hessian matrix elements. During computation of the Hessian matrix of partial second derivatives, any matrix elements with absolute value below HESS-CUTOFF will be set to zero and omitted from the sparse matrix Hessian storage scheme used by Tinker. For most calculations, the default in the absence of this keyword is zero, i.e., all elements will be stored. For most Truncated Newton optimizations the Hessian cutoff will be chosen dynamically by the optimizer.</p>
<p><strong>HGUESS [real]</strong>  Sets an initial guess for the average value of the diagonal elements of the scaled inverse Hessian matrix used by the optimally conditioned variable metric optimization routine. A default value of 0.4 is used in the absence of the HGUESS keyword.</p>

The ONLY option turns off all potential energy terms except for this one.</p>
<p><strong>IMPROPUNIT [real]</strong>  Sets the scale factor needed to convert the energy value computed by the CHARMM-style improper dihedral angle potential into units of kcal/mole. The correct value is force field dependent and typically provided in the header of the master force field parameter file. The default value of (180/Pi)^2 = 0.0003046 is used, if the IMPROPUNIT keyword is not given in the force field parameter file or the keyfile.</p>
<p><strong>IMPTORS [4 integers &amp; up to 3 real/real/integer triples]</strong>  Provides the values for a single AMBER-style improper torsional angle parameter. The first four integer modifiers give the atom class numbers for the atoms involved in the improper torsional angle to be defined. By convention, the third atom class of the four is the trigonal atom on which the improper torsion is centered. The torsional angle computed is literally that defined by the four atom classes in the order specified by the keyword. Each of the remaining triples of real/real/integer modifiers give the half-amplitude, phase offset in degrees and periodicity of a particular improper torsional term, respectively. Periodicities through 3-fold are allowed for improper torsional parameters.</p>
<p><strong>IMPTORSTERM [NONE/ONLY]</strong>  Controls use of the AMBER-style improper torsional angle potential energy term. In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy terms except for this one.</p>
<p><strong>IMPTORSUNIT [real]</strong>  Sets the scale factor needed to convert the energy value computed by the AMBER-style improper torsional angle potential into units of kcal/mole. The correct value is force field dependent and typically provided in the header of the master force field parameter file. The default value of 1.0 is used, if the IMPTORSUNIT keyword is not given in the force field parameter file or the keyfile.</p>
<p><strong>INACTIVE [integer list]</strong>  Sets the list of inactive atoms during a Tinker computation. Individual potential energy terms are not computed when all atoms involved in the term are inactive. For Cartesian space calculations, inactive atoms are not allowed to move. For torsional space calculations, rotations are not allowed when there are inactive atoms on both sides of the rotated bond. Multiple INACTIVE lines can be present in the keyfile, and on each line the keyword can be followed by one or more atom numbers or ranges. If any INACTIVE keys are found, all atoms are set to active except those listed on the INACTIVE lines. The ACTIVE keyword overrides all INACTIVE keywords found in the keyfile.</p>
<p><strong>INDUCE-12-SCALE</strong></p>
<p><strong>INDUCE-13-SCALE</strong></p>
<p><strong>INDUCE-14-SCALE</strong></p>
<p><strong>INDUCE-15-SCALE</strong></p>
<p><strong>INTEGRATOR [VERLET/BEEMAN/STOCHASTIC/RIGIDBODY]</strong>  Chooses the integration method for propagation of dynamics trajectories. The keyword is followed on the same line by the name of the option. Standard Newtonian MD can be run using either VERLET for the Velocity Verlet method, or BEEMAN for the velocity form of Bernie Brook’s “Better Beeman” method. A Velocity Verlet-based stochastic dynamics trajectory is selected by the STOCHASTIC modifier. A rigid-body dynamics method is selected by the RIGIDBODY modifier. The default integration scheme is MD using the BEEMAN method.</p>
<p><strong>INTMAX [integer]</strong>  Sets the maximum number of interpolation cycles that will be allowed during the line search phase of an optimization. All gradient-based Tinker optimization routines use a common line search routine involving quadratic extrapolation and cubic interpolation. If the value of INTMAX is reached, an error status is set for the line search and the search is repeated with a much smaller initial step size. The default value in the absence of this keyword is optimization routine dependent, but is usually in the range 5 to 10.</p>
<p><strong>ION</strong></p>
<p><strong>LAMBDA [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the lambda path parameter for free energy perturbation calculations. The real number modifier specifies the position along the mutation path and must be a number in the range from 0 (initial state) to 1 (final state). The actual atoms involved in the mutation are given separately in individual MUTATE keyword lines.</p>
<p><strong>LBFGS-VECTORS [integer]</strong>  Sets the number of correction vectors used by the limited-memory L-BFGS optimization routine. The current maximum allowable value, and the default in the absence of the LBFGS-VECTORS keyword is 15.</p>
<p><strong>LIGAND</strong></p>
<p><strong>LIGHTS</strong>  Turns on Method of Lights neighbor generation for the partial charge electrostatics and any of the van der Waals potentials. This method will yield identical energetic results to the standard double loop method. Method of Lights will be faster when the volume of a sphere with radius equal to the nonbond cutoff distance is significantly less than half the volume of the total system (i.e., the full molecular system, the crystal unit cell or the periodic box). It requires less storage than pairwise neighbor lists.</p>
<p><strong>LIST-BUFFER [real]</strong>  Sets the size of the neighbor list buffer in Angstroms. This value is added to the actual cutoff distance to determine which pairs will be kept on the neighbor list. The same buffer value is used for all neighbor lists. The default value in the absence of 2.0 is used in the absence of the LIST-BUFFER keyword.</p>
<p><strong>MAXITER [integer]</strong>  Sets the maximum number of minimization iterations that will be allowed for any Tinker program that uses any of the nonlinear optimization routines. The default value in the absence of this keyword is program dependent, but is always set to a very large number.</p>
<p><strong>METAL</strong>  Provides the values for a single transition metal ligand field parameter. Note this keyword is present in the code, but not active in the current version of Tinker.</p>
<p><strong>METALTERM [NONE/ONLY]</strong>  Controls use of the transition metal ligand field potential energy term. In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the potential.

<p><strong>MPOLE-12-SCALE [real]</strong>  Provides a multiplicative scale factor that is applied to permanent atomic multipole electrostatic interactions between 1-2 connected atoms, i.e., atoms that are directly bonded. The default value of 0.0 is used, if the MPOLE-12-SCALE keyword is not given in either the parameter file or the keyfile.</p>
<p><strong>MPOLE-13-SCALE [real]</strong>  Provides a multiplicative scale factor that is applied to permanent atomic multipole  electrostatic interactions between 1-3 connected atoms, i.e., atoms separated by two covalent bonds.

<p><strong>MPOLE-CUTOFF [real]</strong>  Sets the cutoff distance value in Angstroms for atomic multipole potential energy interactions. The energy for any pair of sites beyond the cutoff distance will be set to zero. Other keywords can be used to select a smoothing scheme near the cutoff distance. The default cutoff distance in the absence of the MPOLE-CUTOFF keyword is infinite for nonperiodic systems and 9.0 for periodic systems.</p>
<p><strong>MPOLE-LIST</strong></p>
<p><strong>MPOLE-TAPER [real]</strong>  Modifies the cutoff window for atomic multipole potential energy interactions. It is similar in form and action to the TAPER keyword, except that its value applies only to the atomic multipole potential. The default value in the absence of the MPOLE-TAPER keyword is to begin the cutoff window at 0.65 of the corresponding cutoff distance.</p>
<p><strong>MULTIPOLE [5 lines with: 3 or 4 integers &amp; 1 real; 3 reals; 1 real; 2 reals; 3 reals]</strong>  Provides the values for a set of atomic multipole parameters at a single site. A complete keyword entry consists of three consequtive lines, the first line containing the MULTIPOLE keyword and the two following lines. The first line contains three integers which define the atom type on which the multipoles are centered, and the Z-axis and X-axis defining atom types for this center. The optional fourth integer contains the Y-axis defining atom type, and is only required for locally chiral multipole sites. The real number on the first line gives the monopole (atomic charge) in electrons. The second line contains three real numbers which give the X-, Y- and Z-components of the atomic dipole in electron-Ang. The final three lines, consisting of one, two and three real numbers give the upper triangle of the traceless atomic quadrupole tensor in electron-Ang^2.</p>
<p><strong>MULTIPOLETERM [NONE/ONLY]</strong>  Controls use of the atomic multipole electrostatics potential energy term. In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy terms except for this one.</p>
<p><strong>MUTATE [3 integers]</strong>  Specifies atoms to be mutated during free energy perturbation calculations. The first integer modifier gives the atom number of an atom in the current system.

<p><strong>MUTUAL-11-SCALE [real]</strong>  Provides a multiplicative scale factor that is applied to the induced (mutual) field due to atoms within a polarization group during an induced dipole calculation, i.e., atoms that are in the same polarization group as the atom being polarized. The default value of 1.0 is used, if the MUTUAL-11-SCALE keyword is not given in either the parameter file or the keyfile.</p>
<p><strong>MUTUAL-12-SCALE [real]</strong>  Provides a multiplicative scale factor that is applied to the induced (mutual) field due to atoms in 1-2 polarization groups during an induced dipole calculation, i.e., atoms that are in polarization groups directly connected to the group containing the atom being polarized. The default value of 1.0 is used, if the MUTUAL-12-SCALE keyword is not given in either the parameter file or the keyfile.</p>
<p><strong>MUTUAL-13-SCALE [real]</strong>  Provides a multiplicative scale factor that is applied to the induced (mutual) field due to atoms in 1-3 polarization groups during an induced dipole calculation, i.e., atoms that are in polarization groups separated by one group from the group containing the atom being polarized. The default value of 1.0 is used, if the MUTUAL-13-SCALE keyword is not given in either the parameter file or the keyfile.</p>
<p><strong>MUTUAL-14-SCALE [real]</strong>  Provides a multiplicative scale factor that is applied to the induced (mutual) field due to atoms in 1-4 polarization groups during an induced dipole calculation, i.e., atoms that are in polarization groups separated by two groups from the group containing the atom being polarized. The default value of 1.0 is used, if the MUTUAL-14-SCALE keyword is not given in either the parameter file or the keyfile.</p>
<p><strong>NEIGHBOR-GROUPS</strong>  Causes the attached atom to be used in determining the charge-charge neighbor distance for all monovalent atoms in the molecular system. Its use causes all monovalent atoms to be treated the same as their attached atoms for purposes of including or scaling 1-2, 1-3 and 1-4 interactions. This option works only for the simple charge-charge electrostatic potential; it does not affect bond dipole or atomic multipole potentials. The NEIGHBOR-GROUPS scheme is similar to that used by some common force fields such as ENCAD.</p>
<p><strong>NEIGHBOR-LIST</strong>  Turns on pairwise neighbor lists for partial charge electrostatics, polarize multipole electrostatics and any of the van der Waals potentials. This method will yield identical energetic results to the standard double loop method.</p>
<p><strong>NEUTRAL-GROUPS</strong>  Causes the attached atom to be used in determining the charge-charge interaction cutoff distance for all monovalent atoms in the molecular system. Its use reduces cutoff discontinuities by avoiding splitting many of the largest charge separations found in typical molecules. Note that this keyword does not rigorously implement the usual concept of a “neutral group” as used in the literature with Amber/OPLS and other force fields. This option works only for the simple charge-charge electrostatic potential; it does not affect bond dipole or atomic multipole potentials.</p>
<p><strong>NEWHESS [integer]</strong>  Sets the number of algorithmic iterations between recomputation of the Hessian matrix. At present this keyword applies exclusively to optimizations using the Truncated Newton method. The default value in the absence of this keyword is 1, i.e., the Hessian is computed on every iteration.</p>
<p><strong>NEXTITER [integer]</strong>  Sets the iteration number to be used for the first iteration of the current computation. At present this keyword applies to optimization procedures where its use can effect convergence criteria, timing of restarts, and so forth. The default in the absence of this keyword is to take the initial iteration as iteration 1.</p>
<p><strong>NOARCHIVE</strong>  Causes Tinker molecular dynamics-based programs to write trajectories directly to “cycle” files with a sequentially numbered file extension. The default, in the absence of this keyword, is to write a single plain-text archive file with the .arc format. If an archive file already exists at the start of the calculation, then the newly generated trajectory is appended to the end of the existing file. The default in the absence of this keyword is to write the trajectory snapshots to consecutively numbered cycle files.</p>
<p><strong>NOSYMMETRY</strong>  Forces the use of triclinic periodic boundary conditions and minimum image generation regardless of any symmetry or equilvalent values in the periodic box or crystal lattice values. Used to allow the possibility of symmetry breaking during calculations that begin from a symmetric structure.</p>
<p><strong>NOVERSION</strong>  Turns off the use of version numbers appended to the end of filenames as the method for generating filenames for updated copies of an existing file. The presence of this keyword results in direct use of input file names without a search for the highest available version, and requires the entry of specific output file names in many additional cases. By default, in the absence of this keyword, Tinker generates and attaches version numbers in a manner similar to the Digital OpenVMS operating system. For example, subsequent new versions of the file molecule.xyz would be written first to the file molecule.xyz_2, then to molecule.xyz_3, etc.</p>
<p><strong>OCTAHEDRON</strong>  Specifies that the periodic “box” is a truncated octahedron with maximal distance across the truncated octahedron as given by the A-AXIS keyword. All other unit cell and periodic box size-defining keywords are ignored if the OCTAHEDRON keyword is present.</p>

Values of zero for the third and fourth integers are treated as wildcards, and can represent any atom type. The real number modifier gives the force constant value for the out-of-plane angle. The default units for the force constant are kcal/mole/radian^2, but this can be controlled via the OPBENDUNIT keyword.</p>
<p><strong>OPBEND-CUBIC [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the cubic term in the Taylor series expansion form of the out-of-plane bending potential energy. The real number modifier gives the value of the coefficient as a multiple of the quadratic coefficient.

The default value in the absence of the OPBEND-CUBIC keyword is zero; i.e., the cubic out-of-plane bending term is omitted.</p>
<p><strong>OPBEND-PENTIC [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the fifth power term in the Taylor series expansion form of the out-of-plane bending potential energy.

The default value in the absence of the OPBEND-SEXTIC keyword is zero; i.e., the sextic out-of-plane bending term is omitted.</p>
<p><strong>OPBENDTERM [NONE/ONLY]</strong>  Controls use of the out-of-plane bending potential energy term. In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the potential.

<p><strong>OPBENDUNIT [real]</strong>  Sets the scale factor needed to convert the energy value computed by the out-of-plane bending potential into units of kcal/mole. The correct value is force field dependent and typically provided in the header of the master force field parameter file.

The first integer modifier is the atom class of the central trigonal atom and the three following integer modifiers are the atom classes of the three attached atoms. The real number modifier is the force constant for the harmonic function of the out-of-plane distance of the central atom. The default units for the force constant are kcal/mole/Ang^2, but this can be controlled via the OPDISTUNIT keyword.</p>
<p><strong>OPDIST-CUBIC [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the cubic term in the Taylor series expansion form of the out-of-plane distance potential energy. The real number modifier gives the value of the coefficient as a multiple of the quadratic coefficient. This term multiplied by the out-of-plane distance energy unit conversion factor, the force constant, and the cube of the deviation of the out-of-plane distance from zero gives the cubic contribution to the out-of-plane distance energy. The default value in the absence of the OPDIST-CUBIC keyword is zero; i.e., the cubic out-of-plane distance term is omitted.</p>
<p><strong>OPDIST-PENTIC [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the fifth power term in the Taylor series expansion form of the out-of-plane distance potential energy.

<p><strong>TCG-NOGUESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>TCG-PEEK</strong></p>
<p><strong>THERMOSTAT [BERENDSEN/ANDERSEN]</strong>  Selects a thermostat algorithm for use during molecular dynamics. Two modifiers are available, a Berendsen bath coupling method, and an Andersen stochastic collision method. The default in the absence of the THERMOSTAT keyword is to use the BERENDSEN algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>TORS-LAMBDA</strong></p>
<p><strong>TORSION [4 integers &amp; up to 6 real/real/integer triples]</strong>  Provides the values for a single torsional angle parameter. The first four integer modifiers give the atom class numbers for the atoms involved in the torsional angle to be defined. Each of the remaining triples of real/real/integer modifiers give the amplitude, phase offset in degrees and periodicity of a particular torsional function term, respectively. Periodicities through 6-fold are allowed for torsional parameters.</p>
<p><strong>TORSION4 [4 integers &amp; up to 6 real/real/integer triples]</strong>  Provides the values for a single torsional angle parameter specific to atoms in 4-membered rings. The first four integer modifiers give the atom class numbers for the atoms involved in the torsional angle to be defined. The remaining triples of real number and integer modifiers operate as described above for the TORSION keyword.</p>
<p><strong>TORSION5 [4 integers &amp; up to 6 real/real/integer triples]</strong>  Provides the values for a single torsional angle parameter specific to atoms in 5-membered rings. The first four integer modifiers give the atom class numbers for the atoms involved in the torsional angle to be defined. The remaining triples of real number and integer modifiers operate as described above for the TORSION keyword.</p>
<p><strong>TORSIONTERM [NONE/ONLY]</strong>  Controls use of the torsional angle potential energy term. In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy terms except for this one.</p>
<p><strong>TORSIONUNIT [real]</strong>  Sets the scale factor needed to convert the energy value computed by the torsional angle potential into units of kcal/mole. The correct value is force field dependent and typically provided in the header of the master force field parameter file. The default value of 1.0 is used, if the TORSIONUNIT keyword is not given in the force field parameter file or the keyfile.</p>
<p><strong>TORTORS [7 integers, then multiple lines of 2 integers and 1 real]</strong>  Provides the values for a single torsion-torsion parameter. The first five integer modifiers give the atom class numbers for the atoms involved in the two adjacent torsional angles to be defined. The last two integer modifiers contain the number of data grid points that lie along each axis of the torsion-torsion map. For example, this value will be 13 for a 30 degree torsional angle spacing, i.e., 360/30 = 12, but 13 values are required since data values for -180 and +180 degrees must both be supplied. The subsequent lines contain the torsion-torsion map data as the integer values in degrees of each torsional angle and the target energy value in kcal/mole.</p>
<p><strong>TORTORTERM [NONE/ONLY]</strong>  Controls use of the torsion-torsion potential energy term. In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy terms except for this one.</p>
<p><strong>TORTORUNIT [real]</strong>  Sets the scale factor needed to convert the energy value computed by the torsion-torsion potential into units of kcal/mole. The correct value is force field dependent and typically provided in the header of the master force field parameter file.

<p><strong>TRIAL-DISTANCE [CLASSIC/RANDOM/TRICOR/HAVEL integer/PAIRWISE integer]</strong>  Sets the method for selection of a trial distance matrix during distance geometry computations. The keyword takes a modifier that selects the method to be used. The HAVEL and PAIRWISE modifiers also require an additional integer value that specifies the number of atoms used in metrization and the percentage of metrization, respectively. The default in the absence of this keyword is to use the PAIRWISE method with 100 percent metrization. Further information on the various methods is given with the description of the Tinker distance geometry program.</p>
<p><strong>TRIAL-DISTRIBUTION [real]</strong>  Sets the initial value for the mean of the Gaussian distribution used to select trial distances between the lower and upper bounds during distance geometry computations. The value given must be between 0 and 1 which represent the lower and upper bounds respectively. This keyword is rarely needed since Tinker will usually be able to choose a reasonable value by default.</p>
<p><strong>TRUNCATE</strong>  Causes all distance-based nonbond energy cutoffs to be sharply truncated to an energy of zero at distances greater than the value set by the cutoff keyword(s) without use of any shifting, switching or smoothing schemes. At all distances within the cutoff sphere, the full interaction energy is computed.</p>
<p><strong>UREY-CUBIC [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the cubic term in the Taylor series expansion form of the Urey-Bradley potential energy. The real number modifier gives the value of the coefficient as a multiple of the quadratic coefficient. The default value in the absence of the UREY-CUBIC keyword is zero; i.e., the cubic Urey-Bradley term is omitted.</p>
<p><strong>UREY-QUARTIC [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the quartic term in the Taylor series expansion form of the Urey-Bradley potential energy. The real number modifier gives the value of the coefficient as a multiple of the quadratic coefficient. The default value in the absence of the UREY-QUARTIC keyword is zero; i.e., the quartic Urey-Bradley term is omitted.</p>
<p><strong>UREYBRAD [3 integers &amp; 2 reals]</strong>  Provides the values for a single Urey-Bradley cross term potential parameter. The integer modifiers give the atom class numbers for the three kinds of atoms involved in the angle for which a Urey-Bradley term is to be defined. The real number modifiers give the force constant value for the term and the target value for the 1-3 distance in Angstroms. The default units for the force constant are kcal/mole/Ang^2, but this can be controlled via the UREYUNIT keyword.</p>
<p><strong>UREYTERM [NONE/ONLY]</strong>  Controls use of the Urey-Bradley potential energy term. In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy terms except for this one.</p>
<p><strong>UREYUNIT [real]</strong>  Sets the scale factor needed to convert the energy value computed by the Urey-Bradley potential into units of kcal/mole. The correct value is force field dependent and typically provided in the header of the master force field parameter file. The default value of 1.0 is used, if the UREYUNIT keyword is not given in the force field parameter file or the keyfile.</p>

<p><strong>USOLVE-CUTOFF</strong></p>
<p><strong>USOLVE-DIAG</strong></p>
<p><strong>VDW [1 integer &amp; 3 reals]</strong>  Provides values for a single van der Waals parameter. The integer modifier, if positive, gives the atom class number for which vdw parameters are to be defined. Note that vdw parameters are given for atom classes, not atom types.

<p><strong>VDW-12-SCALE [real]</strong>  Provides a multiplicative scale factor that is applied to van der Waals potential interactions between 1-2 connected atoms, i.e., atoms that are directly bonded. The default value of 0.0 is used, if the VDW-12-SCALE keyword is not given in either the parameter file or the keyfile.</p>
<p><strong>VDW-13-SCALE [real]</strong>  Provides a multiplicative scale factor that is applied to van der Waals potential interactions between 1-3 connected atoms, i.e., atoms separated by two covalent bonds. The default value of 0.0 is used, if the VDW-13-SCALE keyword is not given in either the parameter file or the keyfile.</p>
<p><strong>VDW-14-SCALE [real]</strong>  Provides a multiplicative scale factor that is applied to van der Waals potential interactions between 1-4 connected atoms, i.e., atoms separated by three covalent bonds. The default value of 1.0 is used, if the VDW-14-SCALE keyword is not given in either the parameter file or the keyfile.</p>
<p><strong>VDW-15-SCALE [real]</strong>  Provides a multiplicative scale factor that is applied to van der Waals potential interactions between 1-5 connected atoms, i.e., atoms separated by four covalent bonds.

<p><strong>VDW-ANNIHILATE</strong></p>
<p><strong>VDW-CORRECTION</strong></p>
<p><strong>VDW-CUTOFF [real]</strong>  Sets the cutoff distance value in Angstroms for van der Waals potential energy interactions. The energy for any pair of van der Waals sites beyond the cutoff distance will be set to zero. Other keywords can be used to select a smoothing scheme near the cutoff distance. The default cutoff distance in the absence of the VDW-CUTOFF keyword is infinite for nonperiodic systems and 9.0 for periodic systems.</p>
<p><strong>VDW-LAMBDA</strong></p>
<p><strong>VDW-LIST</strong></p>
<p><strong>VDW-TAPER [real]</strong>  Allows modification of the cutoff windows for van der Waals potential energy interactions. It is similar in form and action to the TAPER keyword, except that its value applies only to the vdw potential. The default value in the absence of the VDW-TAPER keyword is to begin the cutoff window at 0.9 of the vdw cutoff distance.</p>
<p><strong>VDW14 [1 integer &amp; 2 reals]</strong>  Provides values for a single van der Waals parameter for use in 1-4 nonbonded interactions. The integer modifier, if positive, gives the atom class number for which vdw parameters are to be defined. Note that vdw parameters are given for atom classes, not atom types. The two real number modifiers give the values of the atom size in Angstroms and the homoatomic well depth in kcal/mole. Reduction factors, if used, are carried over from the VDW keyword for the same atom class.</p>
<p><strong>VDWINDEX</strong></p>
<p><strong>VDWPR [2 integers &amp; 2 reals]</strong>  Provides the values for the vdw parameters for a single special heteroatomic pair of atoms. The integer modifiers give the pair of atom class numbers for which special vdw parameters are to be defined.

<p><strong>VDWTERM [NONE/ONLY]</strong>  Controls use of the van der Waals repulsion-dispersion potential energy term. In the absence of a modifying option, this keyword turns on use of the potential. The NONE option turns off use of this potential energy term. The ONLY option turns off all potential energy terms except for this one.</p>
<p><strong>VDWTYPE [LENNARD-JONES / BUCKINGHAM / BUFFERED-14-7 / MM3-HBOND / GAUSSIAN]</strong>  Sets the functional form for the van der Waals potential energy term. The text modifier gives the name of the functional form to be used. The GAUSSIAN modifier value implements a two or four Gaussian fit to the corresponding Lennard-Jones function for use with potential energy smoothing schemes. The default in the absence of the VDWTYPE keyword is to use the standard two parameter Lennard-Jones function.</p>
<p><strong>VERBOSE</strong>  Turns on printing of secondary and informational output during a variety of Tinker computations; a subset of the more extensive output provided by the DEBUG keyword.</p>
<p><strong>VIB-ROOTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>VIB-TOLERANCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>VOLUME-MOVE</strong></p>
<p><strong>VOLUME-SCALE</strong></p>
<p><strong>VOLUME-TRIAL</strong></p>
<p><strong>WALL [real]</strong>  Sets the radius of a spherical boundary used to maintain droplet boundary conditions. The real modifier specifies the desired approximate radius of the droplet. In practice, an artificial van der Waals wall is constructed at a fixed buffer distance of 2.5 Angstroms outside the specified radius. The effect is that atoms which attempt to move outside the region defined by the droplet radius will be forced toward the center.</p>
<p><strong>WRITEOUT [integer]</strong>  Sets the number of iterations between writes of intermediate results (such as the current coordinates) to disk file(s) for iterative procedures such as minimizations. The default value in the absence of the keyword is 1, i.e., the intermediate results are written to file on every iteration. Whether successive intermediate results are saved to new files or replace previously written intermediate results is controlled by the OVERWRITE and SAVE-CYCLE keywords.</p>
<p><strong>X-AXIS [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the a-axis length for a crystal unit cell, or, equivalently, the X-axis length for a periodic box. The length value in Angstroms is listed after the keyword. Equivalent to the A-AXIS keyword.</p>
<p><strong>Y-AXIS [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the b-axis length for a crystal unit cell, or, equivalently, the Y-axis length for a periodic box. The length value in Angstroms is listed after the keyword. If the keyword is absent, the Y-axis length is set equal to the X-axis length. Equivalent to the B-AXIS keyword.</p>
<p><strong>Z-AXIS [real]</strong>  Sets the value of the c-axis length for a crystal unit cell, or, equivalently, the Z-axis length for a periodic box. The length value in Angstroms is listed after the keyword. If the keyword is absent, the Z-axis length is set equal to the X-axis length. Equivalent to the C-AXIS keyword.</p>
