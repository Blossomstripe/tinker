                     APBS Directory for the Tinker Package
                     #####################################

      This directory contains static libraries and header files required
      to interface the Tinker package with the APBS 1.3 Poisson-Boltzmann
      code written by Nathan Baker and coworkers. To build APBS-capable
      Tinker executables, use the Tinker source file "pmpb.c" in place of
      the stub file "pmpb.f", then link with APBS libraries found here.

      Any supplied libraries were built with the GNU compilers. Libraries
      are not supplied with some versions of the Tinker distribution. In
      that case, you should obtain APBS 1.3 from the internet, and build
      your own APBS libraries for your desired operating system.

      Note that APBS 1.3 is the earliest version of APBS compatible with
      Tinker. Later versions of APBS should work as well, but we have not
      tested them. The header/include files supplied with Tinker are from
      APBS 1.3 as well.
